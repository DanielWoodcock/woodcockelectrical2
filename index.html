      <h3><b>LED Lighting</b></h3>
        <p>At Woodcock Electrical we provide LED lighting installation for residential and commercial properties.<br>
            Whatever your LED installation requirements are, we have a solution that is right for you.</p>
        <h4>The Benefits of LED lighting</h4>
            <p><b>Energy Savings:</b> LED’s run much more efficiently than your standard light bulbs. They can use up to 80% less power than halogen lights. This saves you money and helps the environment at the same time.</p>
            <p><b>Long Lasting:</b> You can go for years without changing your lamps. LED lights typically have a lifespan of approximately 50,000 hours, whereas standard halogen globes can only last for up to 4000 hours.</p>
            <p><b>Return On Investment:</b> Quality LED lights will give you a much higher return on investment. A typical retrofit of a standard business will pay itself off in 1-2 years and will start to make you money after the payback period.</p>

        <h3><b>EV Chargers</b></h3>
        <p>There are a growing number of public EV charging stations in Australia, both in residential areas and popular travel destinations for popular vehicles such as the Tesla. Some shopping centres, hotels, and tourist attractions and provide EV charging to customers who use their services.</p>
        <p>Of course, the easiest way to charge your electric car is at home using an EV car charging station. Home EV car charging stations can provide up to 10x the power of a standard wall outlet. With an EV home charger, all you have to do is hook up your electric car and it will charge overnight while you sleep. An electric car charger installation makes pumping gas appear obsolete!</p>

        <h3><b>Test and Tag</b></h3>
        <p>The primary reason behind doing testing and tagging is to ensure the safety of the people in the workplace coming into contact with the appliance, while also minimising the risk of an electrical hazard.</p>
        <p>When understanding the test and tag intervals and how often an electrical appliance should be tested, the main underlying factor is the type of environment that appliance is located in. Just as important, the AS/NZS 3760 standard should be seen as a minimum test and tag requirement.</p>
        <p>A lot of workplaces and company owners will have different test and tag frequencies because of their own risk management and OHS planning. Likewise, some of these industries might require you to use certain Test and Tag Colours.</p>
        <p><u>For the most common environments, we recommend the following frequencies:</u><br>
            <b>3 months:</b> Building, Construction and Demolition<br>
            <b>6 months:</b> Factories, Warehouses and Production<br>
            <b>12-24 months:</b> Offices and Residential<br>
            <b>5 yearly:</b> Server room</p>
